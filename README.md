VTHacks is an open source iOS application that will be used by participants at the VTHacks hackathon at Virginia Tech.

The app provides useful information for hackers such as the current schedule, prizes, map, important contacts, and announcements.  However, the main purpose of the application is to distribute information quickly through push notifications to the hundreds of participants that attend the event.

A note on the screenshots above: originally, this application started as a project to create a completely open source application for hackathons; something that could be quickly downloaded and changed within five minutes in order to fit the specific event.  All you would have to do is alter a few variables and assets and you have a new app with all of the core functionality you would need at an event like this.  Who knows, perhaps this could become the application that is used at HackTX, HackFSU, HackSC, etc...(hence the name Hack.\*).  Although we're now focusing primarily on making a great application for VTHacks, we certainly still have the goal of making Hack.* THE best "app starter project" for large events like hackathons.
